I fucking love spaceships! You have no idea!
Spaceships... yeah those are my jam!
You know, I was in a movie where I built a spaceship once. But acting's not for me, I much prefer piloting!
Wow, I really _really_ enjoyed reading that. It wasn't just because you mentioned spaceships, I swear!
Sometimes I ask myself, will people ever get tired of hearing me go on and on about Spaceships? Then I remember that we're talking about fucking spaceships!
When I first began piloting we only had solid blue ships, but I loved it.
*sigh* spaaaceships.....
Vroooom Vroooom <- That's the sound a spaceship makes.
Fun Fact: Spaceships are awesome
Fun Fact: I fly spaceships.
Sometimes I look up in the night sky, at all those spaceships zooming by. "It's beautiful", I think, "but why am I not up there!"
mhmmmmmmmmm
